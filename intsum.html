        <h2>The International Community</h2>

        <h3>How does it work?</h3>

        <div id="blogpost">
            Individuals or groups of plays with a name, a flag and location may apply for membership in the international community.
            After joining our ranks, any members may call a meeting at the international summit -all are free to attend but only members may propose resolutions and vote on them.
            When a resolution passes in the meeting it's written down and voted on further with amendments being proposed until it passes and becomes international law.
            Particpation is entirely voluntary, mostly for fun and the only requirement is following the resolutions that pass. At the summit, nations get one vote regardless of population but when
            voting on resolutions afterwards, Every member of a nation gets their own vote.
