        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>How do I join the server?</h3>

        <p>You can play on any device that is compatible with the bedrock edition of Minecraft - this includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>PC</li>
            <li>Xbox one and series S/X</li>
            <li>Nintendo Switch</li>
            <li>mobile devices/tablets</li>
            <li>Playstation 4/5</li>
        </ul>
        <p> to play on a playstation or xbox console you will need to use <a href="https://bedrocktogether.net/">Bedrock Together</a> - a mobile app that simulates a lan game.</p>
        <p> to play on Nintendo Switch you will need to <a href="https://apexminecrafthosting.com/how-to-join-a-bedrock-edition-server-on-xbox-switch/">change your DNS settings</a></p>

        <h3>Why can't I see my friend's skins?</h3>
        <p>By default minecraft only allows skins from it's own store, if a custom skin is being used then it will use Steve or Alex unless you do the following:
            >Settings > General > Only Allow trusted skins > OFF
        </p>

        <h3>I have too much money clogging up my wallet, how can I get rid of it fast?</h3>
        <p>This server costs us 20 pounds a month to run - that's £240 a year. If you'd like to help us pay for it you can donate <a href="https://paypal.me/CircusWorldMC?country.x=GB&locale.x=en_GB>">here</a>
         - We legally can't claim it will make you smarter or more attractive but it might</p>
